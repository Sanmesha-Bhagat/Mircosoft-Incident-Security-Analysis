# Mircosoft-Incident-Security-Analysis
I have performed data analysis on the Microsoft Security Prediction Kaggle competition dataset using data analytics tools and technologies such as NumPy, Pandas, SQL, Excel, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. My work involved data preprocessing, identifying patterns in the data, and performing data visualization to gain insights from the large dataset.
